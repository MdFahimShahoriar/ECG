## 🔍 Project Overview

This project implements a biometric authentication system using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. ECG-based biometrics offer a unique advantage over traditional biometric methods as they combine **identification capability** with **liveness detection**, making them highly secure against spoofing attacks.

The system processes raw ECG signals, extracts meaningful features, and uses deep learning models to authenticate individuals based on their unique cardiac patterns. This approach is not only secure but also non-invasive and continuous, making it suitable for various applications including healthcare systems, secure facilities, and personal devices.
